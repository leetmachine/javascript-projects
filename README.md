Smileyface matching-
This game displays two panes of smiley faces. The panes are identical, however, there is 1 mismatched smiley face in the left pane. The object of the game is to identify the mismatched smileyface of each level. Each level refreshes but adds five more smileyfaces to increase difficulty. Upon selecting an incorrect smiley face, the game is over.
